# Calculator Project
<br>

## Description
This assignment uses a simple calculator project to explore key GitHub concepts like commits, branching, and merging. You'll practice writing clear commit messages to track code changes and learn how branching helps isolate new features or bug fixes without affecting the main project. These practices are essential for maintaining organized, collaborative, and scalable projects.

## Requirements
- The Amazing Presentation by Mads
- IntelliJ
- A group consisting of **2-4** people
<br>

## Tasks:
1. **Add a new feature branch for each of these tasks and complete them (each person at least one branch and task):**  
     _Hint: Remember to commit the changes you have made, push it, and afterwards merge the branches to the main branch_
   - 1a. Add the content of the **addition** method, so it returns the added value.
   - 1b. Add the content of the **subtraction** method, so it returns the subtracted value.
   - 1c. Add the content of the **multiplication** method, so it returns the multiplied value.
   - 1d. Add the content of the **division** method, so it returns the divided value.  

3. **Now create a class (and a method), that uses the previous methods to return the area of a circle.  
The parameter should be a double that reflects the radius.**
